For Team Treehouse made by [Lindsey](http://www.lindseyk.dev)

In this project, you'll use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, you'll add your own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
After completing this project, you'll have a solid foundational knowledge of using and customizing forms in your projects. This is tremendously valuable since forms are a major aspect of most web sites and web applications, which makes this project a key addition to your portfolio, and a crucial step on your journey to becoming a professional full stack web developer.


1. Finishing the Project
The final stage of the project is perhaps the most important. This is where your developer skills really shine as you carefully double-check that you've accomplished all requirements and that your project is ready for submission.

      * Code Comments - It’s a best practice for development code to be well commented. Replace provided comments with your own to briefly describe your code and what it does.
      * Code Readability - Readability is second only to functionality. Double-check your code to ensure the spacing and indentation is consistent and in keeping with best practices.
      * Quality Assurance Testing - This is a key step in the development process.
      * Open and run your app.
      * Open the Chrome DevTools console and ensure that there are no errors displayed when the app is being used and tested.
      * Pretend to be a user and test all aspects of functionality and every possible state of the app, while monitoring the console for bugs and resolving any that arise.
      Cross Browser Consistency - To pass, your project only needs to work in Chrome but it’s common for developers to test their projects in multiple browsers to know how they will           perform out in the wild.
